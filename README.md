1.	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is the client, and they wanted a software application called "Draw It or Lose It." This application is a web-based distributed game where users can play a drawing game and guess words based on the drawings. The client required game, team, and player management features and secure user interaction.
2.	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
One aspect I did well in developing this documentation was clearly outlining the client's requirements and constraints. I provided detailed explanations of the software's objectives and constraints, which helped guide the design process.
3.	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Developing the design document helped in laying out the structure and architecture of the software application in a systematic manner. It provided a roadmap for the development process, making it easier to translate the design into actual code.
4.	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise one part of the document, I would focus on providing more detailed explanations of certain design decisions and trade-offs. This would enhance the understanding of why certain design choices were made and how they impact the overall system.
5.	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by closely aligning the software design with the client's requirements. By understanding the user's needs, I was able to prioritize features and design an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Considering the user's needs is crucial because ultimately, the success of the software depends on how well it meets the users' requirements and expectations.
6.	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software by first understanding the client's requirements and constraints thoroughly. Then, I utilized techniques such as creating UML diagrams, conducting feasibility studies, and considering scalability and security aspects to design a robust and scalable software architecture. In the future, I would continue to emphasize thorough requirement analysis and utilize agile methodologies to refine and improve the software design iteratively. Additionally, I would leverage tools and frameworks to streamline the design process and enhance collaboration with stakeholders and development teams.
