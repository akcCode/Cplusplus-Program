#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
	To effectively implement user needs into a program, I take a deep dive into understanding the requirements and expectations of end-users. A valuable technique in this process is to create "user stories" which are concise representations of specific user requirements. For instance, a user story could be "As a travel agent, I want a feature to manage and update customer bookings easily." During the program development, I make sure that these user stories serve as a direct guide for translating them into technical requirements and functionalities. By following this approach, I ensure a user-centric development process that aligns development efforts with the intended user experience.

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development?
	When it comes to developing programs, I prefer to use a structured yet flexible methodology. I find that incorporating agile processes, specifically Scrum, greatly improves the development approach. This involves breaking down the development process into manageable parts using short development cycles, or sprints, that typically last 2-4 weeks. We also use iterative development to emphasize continuous collaboration, regular feedback, and efficient adaptation to changes. I aim to integrate key agile processes like Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Reviews, and Sprint Retrospectives, which help ensure a dynamic and responsive development process that aligns with evolving project needs.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software?
  As a member of a software development team, it is crucial to be a good team player to ensure the success of any project. To achieve this, I prioritize effective communication by providing regular updates, actively listening, and articulating my ideas clearly. Collaboration is also essential, and I appreciate the unique contributions of each team member. I am adaptable and willing to accept changes in requirements and technologies, and I actively contribute to problem-solving efforts. I take ownership and accountability for my assigned tasks to ensure a sense of responsibility for the collective success of the team. Additionally, I engage in giving and receiving constructive feedback, viewing it as a valuable tool for personal and team improvement.
