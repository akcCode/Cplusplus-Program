CS 300 Analysis and Design Journal

In my CS 300 projects, I designed a course advising program to manage computer science course information efficiently. I analyzed various data structures and chose a hash table for the program to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of course data. Throughout the project, I encountered challenges, particularly with file handling, edge case management, and ensuring that data was correctly loaded and retrieved from the data structure. I overcame these challenges through debugging, researching best practices, and iterating on my code until it met the requirements. Testing with different inputs helped ensure the robustness of the program and the effectiveness of error handling.
The project expanded my approach to software design by emphasizing the importance of choosing the suitable data structures based on the specific problem. It also reinforced the value of thorough planning and testing before final implementation. I now focus more on considering the trade-offs between different data structures and algorithms during the design phase to optimize performance and maintainability.
Moreover, this project has enhanced my capacity to write maintainable and adaptable code. I have become more mindful of using clear and descriptive variable names, arranging code logically into functions, and providing comprehensive inline comments. This experience has also highlighted the significance of error handling and developing flexible code to adapt to future changes or extensions.
