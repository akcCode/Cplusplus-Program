CS 330 - 3D Scene Project
Project Submission
This repository contains my CS 330 Final Project, showcasing my work in computational graphics:

-3D Scene ZIP Folder – Source files for my project
-Design Decisions Document – Explains my development process

Reflection
Software Design Approach
I focused on structured planning, iterative development, and modular design. Key skills gained:

-Texture mapping & shading for realism
-Camera controls for better scene interaction
-Efficient rendering techniques

Development Approach
I used incremental improvements to refine textures, lighting, and controls. New strategies included:

-Keyboard & mouse interactions
-UV mapping for textures
-Optimized scene performance

Future Applications
This project strengthens my skills for game development, UI/UX, and simulations. Understanding 3D rendering, object transformations, and interactivity will help in VR/AR, software engineering, and data visualization.
