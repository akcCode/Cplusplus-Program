CS 305 Software Security
In the Artemis Financial project, I focused on improving software security by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in handling sensitive data and secure communications. I successfully implemented secure coding practices, including HTTPS and strong encryption methods like AES.
Performing the vulnerability assessment was challenging and insightful. Identifying vulnerabilities required careful review and testing. The most difficult part was ensuring no new vulnerabilities were introduced during refactoring. Additional tests were conducted to verify security and functionality.
To increase security layers, I implemented encryption and secured communication protocols. In the future, I will continue using tools like the OWASP Dependency Check and regular security audits to assess vulnerabilities and decide on mitigation strategies. The resources and tools used during this project will be valuable for future assignments and tasks, especially those involving secure coding and vulnerability assessments.
This assignment highlights my ability to complete a comprehensive vulnerability assessment and apply secure coding practices, which I can showcase to potential employers as evidence of my skills and knowledge in maintaining software security.
