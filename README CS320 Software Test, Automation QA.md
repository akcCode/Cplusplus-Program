CS 320 Portfolio Submission
This portfolio highlights my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance from CS 320. Iâ€™ve included the contact service files from Project One and the summary and reflections report from Project Two, showcasing my skills in designing, implementing, and testing software.

In Project One, I developed a contact management system with clear responsibilities and comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality and security. Secure coding practices, like input constraints, were used to maintain data integrity. The Project Two report reflects on testing strategies and demonstrates my ability to analyze and apply effective methods for reliable software.

These projects taught me the importance of thorough testing, secure coding, and designing modular, user-focused solutions. They represent my growth in creating reliable, maintainable software that meets user needs.
